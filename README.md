## My process

I chosed a different method, instead of working with nodes, queues and stacks, I store the {number of steps, path} in every chess-field. In this case the end-field stores the results also.

### Built with

- JavaScrip
- Multidimensional array for the chess fields
- Store values in objects
- Recursion


### Continued development

I would like to be comfortable with JavaScript methods, responsive web design techniques, css grid, flexbox and JavaScript and want to perfect mobile-first method.


### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard/) - High quality coding education maintained by an open source community.

- [Homepage of Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) - Kevin helpes a lot in responsive techniques. I really liked his teaching style and will follow him in the future also.
