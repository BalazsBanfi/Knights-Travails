## My process

I chosed a different method in the project then suggested, instead of working with nodes, queues and stacks, I store { the number of steps, path } in every chess-field. In this case the end-field stores the results also.

### Built with

- JavaScrip
- Multidimensional array for the chess fields
- Store values in objects
- Git branches, git merge
- Grid, CSS pseudo, change attributes with JavaScript

### Continued development

I would like to be comfortable with JavaScript, responsive web design techniques, css grid, flexbox and want to perfect mobile-first method.

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard/) - High quality coding education maintained by an open source community.

- [Homepage of Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) - Kevin helpes a lot working with responsive techniques. I really liked his teaching style and will follow him in the future also.
